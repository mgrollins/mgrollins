Basic file for 'personal page' repo. Created 10/30/2015, or 20151030 in MS-SQL.

Started a personal page to try and track reading and effort put into learing Python data analysis stack.

I have been having a good time plunging into conda, IPython/Jupyter interactive coding, and plotting -> want to target Bokeh, but starting with some plt basics.

Inspired by starting to listen to podcast.__init__ and hearing about static site generators, Jupyter, and Bokeh.

Brief background:
US Navy - Electrician on submarines
Student - Computer Engineering BS concentrating on networked systems
Current work - Data analysis and reporting for mixed B2B/retail company.
